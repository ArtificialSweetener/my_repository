We drink to our youth to the days come and gone
For the age of oppression is now nearly done
We'll drive out the empire from this land that we own
With our blood and our steel we will take back our home

All hail to Ulfric you are the high king
In your great honor we drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons every one of us dies

Down with Ulfric, the killer of kings
On the day of your death we will drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons everyone of us dies
