A hero, a hero claims a warriors heart
I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn Comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord arts
Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes

It's an end to the evil of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know, the Dragonborns come

Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin
Naal ok zin los vahriin
Wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal
Ahrk fin norok paal graan
Fod nust hon zindro zaan
Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal

We drink to our youth to the days come and gone
For the age of oppression is now nearly done
We'll drive out the empire from this land that we own
With our blood and our steel we will take back our home

All hail to Ulfric you are the high king
In your great honor we drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons every one of us dies

But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean
Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams

All hail to Ulfric you are the high king
In your great honor we drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons every one of us dies
