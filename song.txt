We drink to our youth to the days come and gone
For the age of oppression is now nearly done
We'll drive out the empire from this land that we own
With our blood and our steel we will take back our home

All hail to Ulfric you are the high king
In your great honor we drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons every one of us dies

But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean
Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams

All hail to Ulfric you are the high king
In your great honor we drink and we'll sing
We're the children of Skyrim and we fight all our lives
And when Sovngarde beckons every one of us dies
We drink to our youth to days come and gone
For the age of oppression is now nearly done
